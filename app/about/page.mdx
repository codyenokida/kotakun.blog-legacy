# Who am I?

_Kota Cody Enokida_

It's hard to describe who I am in just a few sentences. I'll try my best!

I'm 24 years old. Japanese-American. I like trying new things and making new memories!

I'm most known by my friends for [biking in random places](/post/vietnam-one), being unable to handle spicy food, loving [One Piece](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRMG8ZQZR/one-piece), and writing this blog.

I'm an avid enjoyer of watching and being a part of technological innovation but my interests mostly lie in _making things_. I find it super fun and rewarding to make things that I think are cool and others think are cool too. Right now, what I make happens to be software.

I graduated from the **University of California, Irvine** with bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I previously worked as a software engineer at [C3 AI](https://c3.ai), [Beyond Limits AI](https://www.beyond.ai/), and was a contributor at [AirSwap](https://airswap.io).

I often take care of my girlfriend's bunny, **Filby** - short for _Filbert_!
