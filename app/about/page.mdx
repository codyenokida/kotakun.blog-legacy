# About

_Kota Cody Enokida_

I'm 24 years old. A Software Developer. I work mostly on the web. I like trying new things and making new memories!

I graduated from the **University of California, Irvine** with bachelor's degree in Computer Science. I previously worked at [C3 AI](https://c3.ai), [Beyond Limits AI](https://www.beyond.ai/), and was a contributor at [AirSwap](https://airswap.io).

I'm most known by my friends for [biking in random places](/post/vietnam-one), being unable to handle spicy food, loving [One Piece](https://www.crunchyroll.com/series/GRMG8ZQZR/one-piece), and writing this blog!

I often take care of my girlfriend's bunny, **Filby** - short for _Filbert_!
