# A Throwback to Mexico

My first ever bicycle trip, treading the Trans-Mexico Bikepacking route, was an adventure as bold as the name would suggest it to be. Trans-Mexico!!! For a sheltered suburban boy like me, this was one hell of an inquiry when my close friend Grant asked me to go with him. Who could have imagined that a single Yes could alter the trajectory of my life?

I’ll attempt to recount my memories as best as I can, as all this transpired 2 years ago. Why write about this now, after so much time has passed? Reminiscing, remembering, and hoping to broaden the world of my readers by a tiny bit. Also, this is probably the most interesting thing I can write about on this blog right now.

We could trace this journey back all the way back to the spring of 2021 — from a single FaceTime call between two boys, one in Irvine and the other in New York.

Both of us, poised to graduate early in December 2021, wanted to see if we could do a graduation trip before we both start working full-time.

“Where you wanna go” - C

“Want to go to Mexico HAHAHAHA” - G

“Sure, I think I’m down.” - C

“Check this out. Wanna bike” - G

“Bet okay, after graduation. Let’s do it, seems doable LOL” - C

I remember it honestly being as simple as that. It didn’t take much convincing for me to be like, hey this is great, and this isn’t a crazy idea — part of the reason was how naive I was and also maybe an inner desire to get out of my sheltered surroundings. Grant has told me that for how easily I was down for this adventure, he had no faith I would actually commit to the outlandish plans we were joking and drawing up. Keep in mind, at that point, I hadn’t ridden a bicycle in years, this was my first time out of the country (besides Japan), and this was a bike-packing tour with wild camping in a foreign country, a “dangerous” one at that, with no experience on both ends.

Now, here we were in January 2022. On our way with our bikes packed, heading to our first destination Mazatlán, Mexico.

There was a sense of nervousness, but it was always masked by the adrenaline of being a part of an expedition like this.

Mexico was breathtaking and eye-opening in a lot of ways.

It was the first time I was exposed to Latin American culture up close. There was this authenticity, generosity, and hospitality I had never encountered before in my life. I found it fascinating that the culture and the language complimented and encompassed Latin American values of family and respect so well.

Traveling and living life without much of a plan was also a new concept to me at the time. It’s definitely not something you can get easily accustomed to, but once you get past the initial discomfort, you see there’s a whole new dimension of experiences that get unlocked.

Mexico was also the perfect place to break some preconceived stereotypes. Most folks that knew about our trip recommended us to not go, to go somewhere safer or try another place more familiar. Albeit very valid advice, we did our research and had the conviction that Mexico was not as dangerous as many perceive it to be. This turned out to be 95% true. The other 5% in some contained areas was a reminder that there are always some uncontrollable external forces. However, you can minimize risk by preparing yourself enough for scenarios and avoiding situations that will put you in those dangerous spots. That’s true in all facets of life.

I look back and laugh at how intense this trip was. I’d imagine a usual intro to bike touring would be going through Europe or embarking on a small few-day trip. But this trail was an 8/10 difficulty on bikepacking.com 🤣. The funny thing is I thought that bikepacking was always this intense, and it wasn’t until my most recent trip to SE Asia that I realized that bikepacking is usually pretty relaxing and that Mexico was just insanely wild off the bat.

Here’s a picture dump of our adventure from Mazatlán to Guanajuato, spanning roughly 3 weeks!
